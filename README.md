## Reanalysis considered

### CARRA (Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis)

- 3h resolution at 2.5 km
- 10.24381/cds.713858f6
- Ridal, Martin, et al. "CERRA, the Copernicus European Regional Reanalysis system." Quarterly Journal of the Royal
  Meteorological Society (2024).
- [cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-carra-single-levels](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-carra-single-levels?tab=overview)

> [!NOTE]
> (from the official website) The C3S Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) dataset contains 3-hourly analyses and hourly
> short term forecasts of
> atmospheric and surface meteorological variables (surface and near-surface temperature, surface and top of atmosphere
> fluxes, precipitation, cloud, humidity, wind, pressure, snow and sea variables) at 2.5 km resolution. Additionally,
> forecasts up to 30 hours initialised from the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available.
> The dataset includes two domains. The West domain covers Greenland, the Labrador Sea, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay,
> Denmark Strait, Iceland, Jan Mayen, the Greenland Sea and Svalbard. The East domain covers Svalbard, Jan Mayen, Franz
> Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, Barents Sea, and the Northern parts of the Norwegian Sea and Scandinavia.
> The dataset has been produced with the use of the HARMONIE-AROME state-of-the-art non-hydrostatic regional numerical
> weather prediction model. High resolution reanalysis for the Arctic region is particularly important because the
> climate change is more pronounced in the Arctic region than elsewhere in the Earth. This fact calls for a better
> description of this region providing additional details with respect to the global reanalyses (ERA5 for instance). The
> additional information is provided by the higher horizontal resolution, more local observations (from the Nordic
> countries and Greenland), better description of surface characteristics (high resolution satellite and physiographic
> data), high resolution non-hydrostatic dynamics and improved physical parameterisation of clouds and precipitation in
> particular.
> The inputs to CARRA reanalysis are the observations, the ERA5 global reanalysis as lateral boundary conditions and the
> physiographic datasets describing the surface characteristics of the model. The observation values and information
> about their quality are used together to constrain the reanalysis where observations are available and provide
> information for the data assimilation system in areas in where less observations are available.

### ERA5

- 1 h resolution at 0.25° x 0.25°
- 10.24381/cds.143582cf
- [cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-complete](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-complete?tab=overview)

> [!NOTE]
> (from the official website) ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering
> the
> period from January 1940
> to present1. It is produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) at ECMWF and provides hourly estimates of a
> large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 31km grid and resolve
> the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes an ensemble component at half
> the resolution to provide information on synoptic uncertainty of its products.
> ERA5 uses a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model to assimilate a variety of observations,
> including satellite and ground-based measurements, and produces a comprehensive and consistent view of the Earth's
> atmosphere. These products are widely used by researchers and practitioners in various fields, including climate
> science, weather forecasting, energy production and machine learning among others, to understand and analyse past and
> current weather and climate conditions.

### ERA5-LAND

- 1 h resolution at 0.1° x 0.1°
- 10.24381/cds.e2161bac
- [cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview)

> [!NOTE]
> (from the official website) ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land
> variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying
> the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across
> the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that
> goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past.
> ERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and
> air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the
> model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the
> production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation.
> In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for
> the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction
> is called 'lapse rate correction'.
> The ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical
> models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different
> components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because
> the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields
> can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields. The temporal and spatial
> resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or
> drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period covered in time, as well as the
> fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers, businesses and individuals to access
> and use more accurate information on land states.

# THAAO reference instruments

Instrument involved are HATPRO (IWV, LWP), aws_ECAPAC (temp, press, rh, windd, winds), aws_vespa (temp, press, rh,
windd, winds), VESPA (iwv), sw radiometers (up and down), radiosoundings (iwv)
The reference values are always from THAAO measurements, except for IWV (ref: VESPA) and LWP (ref:HATPRO)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code can be run at whichever time resolution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pixel extraction is done before running this code using ``cdo remapnn`` for pixel 76.5, -68.8 which has a few
> hundreds meters offset from the exact location.

> [!TIP]
> wind component combination, conversion from dewpoint temperature to rh and similar, have been performed using the
``metpy`` package.

# Statistics

## Time series

## Scatterplots

> [!WARNING]
> The scatterplots containing all season data is a 2D density histogram, meaning that not all data are
> plotted (there are too many, and they would result overlaid), therefore the colorbar towards the warm color indicates
> higher density of values in that bin. For scatterplots with a limited number of data the result is a few number of
> points compared to the variable N (printed). Seasonal scatterplots are standard.
